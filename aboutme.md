I grew up in a small village of eastern China.  
A grand cycling trip as a college freshman inspired me to pursue a career in biological research. 
Since then I have examined fish populations in the Three Gorges Dam in China and alpine ferns on the Tibetan Plateau. 
My current work explores genetic mechanism of adaptation of poplars to high latitude (the Arctic) and of corns to high altitude regions using genomic data. 
Outside of work, I love running, reading, writing and meditation.
