##For broader readers

I grew up in a small village of eastern China. A grand cycling trip as a college freshman inspired me to pursue a career in biological research. 
Since then I have examined fish populations in the Three Gorges Dam in China and alpine ferns on the Tibetan Plateau. 
My current work explores genetic mechanism of adaptation of poplars to high latitude (the Arctic) and of corns to high altitude regions using genomic data. 
Outside of work, I am a mother of two boys. I love running, reading, writing and meditation. 

##For scientific peers

I am currently a postdoc researcher working with [Dr. Matthew Hufford](http://www.public.iastate.edu/~mhufford/HuffordLab/home.html) in the Department of Ecology, Evolution, and Organismal Biology at [Iowa State University](https://www.iastate.edu/). 
Since the very beginning of my scientific research, I have worked on various plant groups, ranging from non-flowering vascular plants(ferns), trees to crops. 
Between 2006 and 2011, I did my PhD with [Dr. Xianchun Zhang](http://sourcedb.ib.cas.cn/cn/expert/201212/t20121209_3702157.html) and [Dr. Harald Schneider](http://sourcedb.xtbg.cas.cn/zw/zjrck/yjy/201705/t20170505_4784092.html) to exploring the systematics and evolution of a fern group occurring on Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau.
To follow my intention of expanding my skills on dealing with genomic dataset, I worked on how latitude adaptation and sexual dimorphism reflect on gene expression difference in poplar trees using transcriptome data with [Dr. Matt Olson](http://www.faculty.biol.ttu.edu/olson/Welcome.html).
