## parallel adaptation in maize highland landraces
Maize was domesticated in the lowlands of the Balsas River Valley in southwest Mexico. 
Subsequent to domestication, maize spread from its center of origin to vastly different environments. 
In some instances, similar new environments were occupied in parallel--for example, the cool highlands of Guatemala, the southwestern United States, the Mexican Central Plateau, and the Andes. 
In the context of parallel highland colonization, we are investigating two primary evolutionary questions in maize: 1) What is the evidence for local adaptation to highland conditions? and 2) Have putative highland adaptations involved a similar set of alleles and/or loci? 
We are currently using growth chamber experiments to assess evidence for local adaptation and taking a comparative genomic approach to identify candidate loci for adaptation.

## demography and its effect on distribution of deleterious mutations 

This study illustrates how demographic factors such as population size change and gene flow, in combination with natural selection, have historically shaped diversity across maize genomes and populations.
Despite increases in census size, maize experienced several millennia of decline in diversity after the onset of domestication and during its spread across the Americas.
This 'cost of domestication' has increased the prevalence of deleterious alleles in maize relative to its wild progenitor,  particularly in the Andes where maize appears to have undergone a dramatic founder event.
During migration, certain populations of maize also captured new alleles from wild relatives, a process that appears to have reduced the burden of deleterious alleles.

The history of maize has been characterized by major demographic events including changes in population size associated with domestication and range expansion as well as gene flow with wild relatives.
The interplay between demographic history and selection has shaped diversity across maize populations and genomes.
Here, we investigate these processes based on high-depth resequencing data from 31 maize landraces spanning the pre-Columbian distribution of maize as well as four wild progenitor individuals (\emph{Zea mays} ssp. \emph{parviglumis}) from the Balsas River Valley in Mexico.
Genome-wide demographic analyses reveal that maize domestication and spread resulted in pronounced declines in effective population size due to both a protracted bottleneck and serial founder effects, while, concurrently, \emph{parviglumis} experienced population growth.
The cost of maize domestication and spread was an increase in deleterious alleles in the domesticate relative to its wild progenitor.
This cost is particularly pronounced in Andean maize, which appears to have experienced a more dramatic founder event when compared to other maize populations.
Introgression from the wild teosinte \emph{Zea mays} ssp. \emph{mexicana} into maize in the highlands of Mexico and Guatemala is found to decrease the prevalence of deleterious alleles, likely due to the higher long-term effective population size of wild maize.
These findings underscore the strong interaction between historical demography and the efficiency of selection species- and genome-wide and suggest domesticated species with well-characterized histories may be particularly useful for understanding this interplay.


## sex dimorphism in _Populus balsamifera_

Traits that exhibit sexual dimorphism have been reported in dioecious plant species, but little is known about gene expression differences that may underlie these traits. We compared gene expression in male and female flowers and leaves of Populus balsamifera to assess the extent of sex-biased expression. 
RNA-seq was used to estimate steady-state transcript abundance in leaves and flowers for five males and five females. We quantified differential gene expression between male and female leaves and flowers, functionally annotated the resulting genes with MapMan and topGO, and estimated rates of dN/dS using paml.
Over 11,000 genes showed sex-biased expression in flowers, including PbRR9, a gene located in the sex determination region and the only gene that exhibits sex-biased methylation. Only one gene, of unknown function, was differentially expressed in male and female leaves. Female-biased genes were associated with photosynthetic pathways, whereas male-biased genes were associated with mitochondrial regulatory pathways. Sex-limited genes did not exhibit elevated rates of protein evolution, contrary to predictions from other studies in animals and plants. 
Our study supports recent hypotheses of sexual homomorphism in secondary sexual characteristics of poplars, and indicated that ongoing disruptive selection driving dimorphisms in primary floral tissues is weak.


## phylogeny, diversification and phylogeography of a fern genus - _Lepisorus_

**phylogeny**
Phylogenetic relationships within the paleotropical genus Lepisorus (Polypodiaceae) were investigated using plastid DNA sequences from four regions: rbcL, rps4 and rps4-trnS IGS, trnL intron plus trnL-F IGS, rbcL-atpB IGS. Over 4000 nucleotides were sequenced for 77 specimens belonging to 54 species. Each cpDNA region was analyzed separately and combined into a single dataset. All phylogenetic analyses, maximum parsimony, maximum likelihood and Bayesian Inference of phylogeny, revealed the paraphyly of Lepisorus with the monotypic Drymotaenium miyoshianum and of the paleotropical genus Belvisia nested within the Lepisorus clade. Nine well-supported major clades were found. The phylogenetic results provided new evidence for the sectional classification of Lepisorus. The evolution of three morphological characters, clathrateness of rhizome scales, margin of rhizome scales and defoliated leaves, and the evo- lution of the karyotype, were reconstructed to identify lineage specific phenotypic character states or combination of characters. Unique character combinations, rather than synapomorphies, were found to be of systematic value in sectional delimitation. The variation of chromosome numbers is largely due to a single aneuploidy event instead of a stepwise reduction during the evolutionary history of this genus.

**diversification**
Background: The rise of high mountain chains is widely seen as one of the factors driving rapid diversification of land plants and the formation of biodiversity hotspots. Supporting evidence was reported for the impact of the rapid rise of the Andean mountains but this hypothesis has so far been less explored for the impact of the “roof of the world”. The formation of the Himalaya, and especially the rise of the Qinghai–Tibetan Plateau in the recent 20 million years, altered the monsoon regimes that dominate the current climates of South East Asia. Here, we infer the hypothesis that the rise of Himalaya had a strong impact on the plant diversity in the biodiversity hotspot of the Southwest Chinese Mountains.
Results: Our analyses of the diversification pattern of the derived fern genus Lepisorus recovered evidence for changes in plant diversity that correlated with the strengthening of South East Asian monsoon. Southwest China or Southwest China and Japan was recovered as the putative area of origin of Lepisorus and enhancing monsoon regime were found to shape the early diversification of the genus as well as subsequent radiations during the late Miocene and Pliocene.
Conclusions: We report new evidence for a coincidence of plant diversification and changes of the climate caused by the uplift of the Himalaya. These results are discussed in the context of the impact of incomplete taxon sampling, uncertainty of divergence time estimates, and limitations of current methods used to assess diversification rates.

**phylogeography**
Background: The Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau (QTP) and its southern and southeastern mountain ranges, Himalaya-Hengduan Mountains (HHM), are one of the most extensive habitats for alpine plants in the world. How ferns occurring in QTP and HHM changed their distribution ranges in response to Quaternary climatic oscillations remains almost unknown.
Methodology and Results: We employed sequences of two chloroplast DNA regions, rps4-trnS and trnL-trnF, to reconstruct phylogeography of the Sino-Himalayan fern Lepisorus clathratus, occurring mainly in the QTP and HHM. Individuals of this species have either dehiscent or indehiscent sporangia with the latter evolved from the plesiomorphic dehiscent forms. Based on a range-wide sampling, we detected 27 cpDNA haplotypes that were divided into five groups by network analyses. Populations in the Hengduan Mountains possess the highest genetic diversity, while a single haplogroup is detected across the north-central region. A distinct phylogeographical subdivision was detected between the Hengduan Mountains and north-central region by AMOVA analysis. The haplogroup distribution pattern, coalescence and AMOVA analysis suggest that a long term survival area (refugia) of the species was located in the Hengduan Mountains during glaciations, with probable range expansions into north-central regions during interglacial periods. Populations with indehiscent sporangium can carry private haplotypes and are inclined to maintain genetic homogeneity. One group with indehiscent sporangia most likely survived in situ on the QTP during glaciations.
Conclusions/Significance: This study for the first time sheds light on the response of alpine ferns in the QTP and HHM to the Quaternary climatic oscillations.

Background: Indehiscent sporangia are reported for only a few of derived leptosporangiate ferns. Their evolution has been likely caused by conditions in which promotion of self-fertilization is an evolutionary advantageous strategy such as the colonization of isolated regions and responds to stressful habitat conditions. The Lepisorus clathratus complex provides the opportunity to test this hypothesis because these derived ferns include specimens with regular dehiscent and irregular indehiscent sporangia. The latter occurs preferably in well-defined regions in the Himalaya. Previous studies have shown evidence for multiple origins of indehiscent sporangia and the persistence of populations with indehiscent sporangia at extreme altitudinal ranges of the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau (QTP).
Results: Independent phylogenetic relationships reconstructed using DNA sequences of the uniparentally inherited chloroplast genome and two low-copy nuclear genes confirmed the hypothesis of multiple origins of indehiscent sporangia and the restriction of particular haplotypes to indehiscent sporangia populations in the Lhasa and Nyingchi regions of the QTP. In contrast, the Hengduan Mountains were characterized by high haplotype diversity and the occurrence of accessions with and without indehiscent sporangia. Evidence was found for polyploidy and reticulate evolution in this complex. The putative case of chloroplast capture in the Nyingchi populations provided further evidence for the promotion of isolated but persistent populations by indehiscent sporangia.
Conclusions: The presented results confirmed the hypothesis that indehiscent sporangia promote the establishment of persistent population in different regions of the QTP. These results are consistent with the expectations of reproductive reassurance by promotion of self-fertilization that played a critical role in the assembly of populations in isolated locations and/or extreme habitats.
