## parallel adaptation in maize highland landraces
Maize was domesticated in the lowlands of the Balsas River Valley in southwest Mexico. 
Subsequent to domestication, maize spread from its center of origin to vastly different environments. 
In some instances, similar new environments were occupied in parallel--for example, the cool highlands of Guatemala, the southwestern United States, the Mexican Central Plateau, and the Andes. 
In the context of parallel highland colonization, we are investigating two primary evolutionary questions in maize: 1) What is the evidence for local adaptation to highland conditions? and 2) Have putative highland adaptations involved a similar set of alleles and/or loci? 
We are currently using growth chamber experiments to assess evidence for local adaptation and taking a comparative genomic approach to identify candidate loci for adaptation.
