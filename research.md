## parallel adaptation in _Zea mays_ 
Subsequent to domestication, maize spread from its center of origin to several independent highland regions, such as Southwestern US highlands and the Andes. Highland maize demonstrated denser macrohair and darker pigmentation.

Using whole genome re-sequencing data of samples from six populations (four highland and two lowland populations), we are investigating two primary questions: 1) What is the evidence for local adaptation to highland conditions? and 2) Have putative highland adaptations involved a similar set of alleles, genes, or pathways? If yes, what are them and their functions?

Using de-novo assembly of genomes of two highland and two lowland landraces (from Mexico and South America respectively), we are exploring the structure variation important for highland adaptation, such as gene presence absence variation (PAV), copy number variation (CNV), inversion polymorphism etc.

## demography and mutation load in maize and its wild relatives 

The history of maize has been characterized by major demographic events including changes in population size associated with domestication and range expansion as well as gene flow with wild relatives.
These demographic factors, in combination with natural selection, have historically shaped diversity across maize genomes and populations.
In this study, we investigated these processes based on high-depth resequencing data from 31 maize landraces spanning the pre-Columbian distribution of maize as well as four wild progenitor individuals (_Zea mays_ ssp. _parviglumis_) from the Balsas River Valley in Mexico.
Genome-wide demographic analyses reveal that maize domestication and spread resulted in pronounced declines in effective population size due to both a protracted bottleneck and serial founder effects(characterized by gradual decline of genetic diversity when moving away from its origin center), while, concurrently, _parviglumis_ experienced population growth.

The cost of maize domestication and spread was an increase in deleterious alleles in the domesticate relative to its wild progenitor.
This cost is particularly pronounced in Andean maize, which appears to have experienced a more dramatic founder event when compared to other maize populations.

Introgression from the wild teosinte _Zea mays_ ssp. _mexicana_ into maize was not restricted to the sympatric highland population (Mexican Central Plateau), but also occur in non-sympatric Mesoamerica populations (Guatemalan and Southwestern US highland populations). The introgressed haplotypes were found to decrease the prevalence of deleterious alleles, likely due to the higher long-term effective population size of wild maize.

## sex dimorphism in _Populus balsamifera_

Traits that exhibit sexual dimorphism have been reported in dioecious plant species, but little is known about gene expression differences that may underlie these traits. General questions such as the commonality of sexual dimorphisms in dioecious plants, how and whether dimorphisms evolve in similar tissues and for similar traits in different dioecious taxa, and the forms of natural or sexual selection that drive the evolution of these sexual dimorphisms remain relatively unexplored.

We compared gene expression in male and female flowers and leaves of _Populus balsamifera_ to assess the extent of sex-biased expression. RNA-seq was used to estimate steady-state transcript abundance in leaves and flowers for five males and five females. We quantified differential gene expression between male and female leaves and flowers, functionally annotated the resulting genes with MapMan and topGO, and estimated rates of dN/dS using paml.

We found sex-biased expression is prominent in flowers, but minimal in leaves. 
Among sex-biased genes in flowers, photosynthetic pathways was enriched and dominated with female-biased genes (up-regulated in female); whereas the other enriched pathway - mitochondrial regulatory pathways was mainly composed of male-biased genes. 
Sex-biased or sex-limited genes did not exhibit elevated rates of protein evolution, contrary to predictions from other studies in animals and plants, which might support
the hypotheses of sexual homomorphism in secondary sexual characteristics of poplars, and indicated that ongoing disruptive selection driving dimorphisms in primary floral tissues is weak.

## phylogeny, diversification and phylogeography of a fern genus - _Lepisorus_

_Lepisorus_ is a derived fern genus and distributed mainly in the Southwest chinese mountain regions. By sampling most species in the genus, we answered the following questions: 
* What is the phylogenetic relationship of species within the genus and what kind of traits could be used to define the sections and species?
* Have the rise of Qinghai-Tebetan Plateau (QTP) and the incurred change of monsoon regimes accelerated the diversification of species in the genus?

Within the genus, the _Lepisorus clathratus_ complex mainly occurred at  QTP and its southern and southeastern mountain ranges, Himalaya-Hengduan Mountains (HHM). We are fascinated with the following questions: 

* How did ferns occurring in QTP and HHM change their distribution ranges in response to Quaternary climatic oscillations?
* Did specific traits help these ferns adapt to QTP? 
  _Indehiscent sporangia promoted self fertilization, reassured the reproductive success and thus help establish persistent populations in in isolated locations and/or extreme habitats on QTP._
* How did polyploidization and putative hybridization correlated with high altitude adaptation?
