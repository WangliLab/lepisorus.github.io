Comments on [Henn et al. 2016](http://www.pnas.org/content/113/4/E440.abstract)

The main findings reported in the paper were previously reported. As the authors stressed, the gradient in number of deleterious alleles (especially moderately and large effect deleterious alleles) per individual with distance from Africa (echoing with serial founder effects) distinguished their study from pervious ones, which only used a single bottleneck to explain the difference between African and non-African populations.

The authors clearly presented their results. They compared the difference in deleterious alleles both at the individual and the population level. They also calculated the population load at two extreme situations: completely recessive and additive, which can quantify the difference of genetic load at population level.

Last point needed to be re-examined: it shows > 90% deleterious variants in humans are actually common variants (in relatively high frequency), which strikes me and inspired to examine pattern of deleterious alleles on singletons and non-singletons.

An interesting point: in non-African population, deleterious alleles (not the extremely strong deleterious one) evolved just like neutral alleles, as NeS << 1 and genetic drift dictates the change of allele frequency.

Overall, it is a clearly-written paper and deserve my learning.
