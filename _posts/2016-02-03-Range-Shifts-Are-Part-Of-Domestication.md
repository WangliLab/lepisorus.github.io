This is a pretty short correspondence in <Frontiers of Biogeography>.

Traditional studies on plant/animal domestication focused mainly on when and where the species were domesticated (temporal dimension). The author is trying to draw our attention from the temporal dimension to the spatial dimension, that is, how the species colonized the new ranges.  He pointed out that domestication is not one-time event at the origin center; that was only the first stage. During the range shifts, farmers kept selecting varieties, which performed better at local niche. This process was always involved with human-induced genetic bottleneck. The human-mediated range shift and the following artificial selection is a crucial part for understanding domestication and for conservation and utilization of genetic resources.

The point of this paper could be written into the introduction of my manuscript.
