One suggestion taken from writing group: ask  your professor “Why I need to do this? ” as often as you are unclear.

Go frequently to talks and seminars because that is designed for you, at least once a week. Maybe you can find your role model, learn a bit from each speaker and assemble them in your mind. So, take the chance of the Panzea meeting every week.

Build social network with non-Chinese. Avoid to only make native friends. Get to know American families, and you will get chance to speak English. That is a big compliment.

Open the door, step into the house and you get to know what is inside. Otherwise, you never know. When chatting with people, stay away from the topics, such as religion, money etc, because that is something you can not change other’s attitude.

Turn on the radio for talk show program even 24 hours per day. WOI from Des Moise. You do not need music. You will be surprised how much you learned.

Donot be shy. If you are shy, you are hurting yourself. Nobody is going to criticize you.

**Professorship is not a job. It is an opportunity.**

Continuously working on a paper, do not leave it two or three weeks and then come back. ANYBODY QUITTING WRITING A YEAR OR TWO IS DIFFICULT TO GET IT BACK. Each time you left the manuscript a long time and came back, you need to educate yourself. Writing is a everyday habit.
