As a training scientist, i have not seriously thought about the demanding qualities of a successful scientist.

As a venue to accomplish the 30 minutes writing task per day and for the reason that I have not red any paper this week, I came out of this topic.

Here I am listing the qualities, which I esteem a high rank for becoming a better scientist:

* Asking interesting questions

_It is not an easy one, based on a lot of reading of related topics and previous research and the ability to summarize things._

* Critic and logic thinking

_Donot trust what the others said without your own thinking, even the most famous one. It is also based on the solid base of theory in your fields_

* Scientific writing

_You can never over-evaluate its significance in the scientific career. That is what I am training myself in this year, 2016_

* Communication skills

_Are you brave enough to initiate a relationship with your colleagues? Either inviting him/her for a lunch or suggesting a collaboration project? It is commonly required skill for any job position. I need to work on this. Trying to have lunch/ chat with a stranger at least once a week. Even though such small targets, it is difficult to achieve_

* Mentoring/teaching ability

_I have the interest and passion to convey my knowledge to others. If I have graduate/postdoctor students, I would exchange with them our dreams. And I would like to help them achieve their dreams regarding their career. I think that is the coolest part of becoming a professor._

* Public speech

_I improved a lot on this during my graduate study benefiting from my supervisor. Once I won a prize for the oral presentation in UK, an English country. I feel confident and interested with this. I joined in the toastmaster club after arriving at US and before my sonâ€™s birth. It helped a lot too._

* Leadership

_My weak points. I donot like to stand out from a crowd and take the job as an organizer / a leader. Be aware of this is itself an improvement._

* Management

_It could be management of time, energy, funds etc.. I think it is quite similar to the management of personal life and work. Just to remember: donot waste your time, as it is the component of your life._

**Last but not the least, interest and passion are probably the most important of becoming a successful scientist.**
